    <h2>Personal Information and Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Regi Cruz. I am an 18-year-old tertiary student currently studying at RMIT enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology. My country of origin is in Philippines, born in Davao City, located on the Philippine Island of Mindanao on the 28/08/2003. Despite me being born from a foreign country, I can only really speak English fluently and only have little knowledge of Tagalog. This due to me living in Dublin, Ireland shortly after I was born, only up until 2010 that I moved to Australia.</p>
    <h3>Facts about me and my hobbies</h3>
    <h4>Where I have been in the world...</h4>
    <p>As mentioned previously, I never spent as much time in my life in my home country, as well as not really speaking as much Tagalog. This due to me living in Dublin, Ireland for the entirety of my childhood. While I have visited the Philippines every now and then during the 2000’s period, it wasn’t until in the midyear of 2010 that I moved over to Australia, where from that time on, I have lived, studied in this country for nearly 12 years now. </p>
    <h4>My Love for Gaming</h4>
    <p>I loved gaming, ever since I was a child. The earliest memory I had playing games was when I was playing on handheld consoles. I believed it started with the Gameboy Advanced SP, followed by the Nintendo DS and PSP. Then came the actual consoles, I had the Wii as part of my birthday present back in Ireland, followed by the Xbox 360 and PS3. Around this time, I never really had played online games with these consoles, nor I really had any friends to play with aside from my family and cousins. But, around the time I got my PS4, I started to be confident to people more, eventually finding online friends that I can always go to every day after school. And even transitioning to PC, while I am away with them, I am grateful for the time we spent, as well as the moments we shared. I keep in touch with some of them to this day. </p>
    <h4>My Special Talent</h4>
    <p>Much to people’s surprise, I can sing. While it may not be the best, my vocals are surprising, good according to others, and I’m motivated to improve on that occasionally, alongside my skills in IT. Even its just simply singing a song to others, it’s also a way to improve my confidence, whether I sing in front of others or not. I will be presenting something to others in one way or another. And I have had my history of performing songs in front of others, either in a group, choir back in my primary school days, but by the time I reached high school, I stopped until I got back into it in 2019, doing solo performances with each performance being better and improving than the last. It was quite the experience, and I don’t mind singing in front of others should the situation be appropriate for everyone!</p>

  <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
    <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
    <p>My interest in IT is just all around. Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing video games. Due to this, I eventually researched that it is through the many components of the consoles that make video games come to life. This eventually sparked my interest in not only Computers, but as well as an interest in cyber security as time went on. By the time I was in high school, in year 10, I’ve taken the computing course. From there I had my first experience in creating databases using Microsoft Access and Excel. I have done some programming using python, and project planning through using Gantt charts through that subject.</p>
    <p>Despite some of the difficulties and challenges that came with the assessments, it was still subject that I found interesting and a subject I thought that I would enjoy learning. Which was why I continued to learn computing for Year 11 VCE and Year 12 VCE for data analytics. And now that I’m in the course, its both refreshing and nostalgic seeing some of the programs that I have used mentioned and being used.</p>
    <h3>Why am I studying at RMIT?</h3>
    <p>I chose to come to RMIT because I believe that it is the right university that will set me on the right path with IT. Being a university that is the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, I trust that it will be a fun and amazing experience to study, as well as to understand what the IT industry has to offer just by studying here and being aided by people who come from different fields of IT, which will help me decide what field to I want to partake in the future for my career. While I know currently that I wish to pursue in a career of Security, it can obviously change in the next 3 years where I experience and learn the many areas, facts, and things that the IT industry has to offer, as it is always evolving, there are endless possibilities where the industry can take me. </p>
    <h3>What do I expect in learning at RMIT?</h3>
    <p>I expect to learn about the various fields of IT. Whether it be coding, creating, and managing databases or planning a project, it will all be worth learning in the end. Additionally, I expect to learn soft skills as I know for a fact that teamwork, communication, organization and planning are really useful skills and play a part with people effectively using these skills in the IT industry, considering the amount of collaboration that is needed in the coming assignments, while it may be difficult, its better to face challenges with people that have particularly the same interests, but from different backgrounds, different skills and strengths and weaknesses so that we can balance each other out from each and everyone’s weaknesses and learn from each other.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
      <img src="job_ad.png" alt="JobAd">
      <h4>Description and appeal</h4>
      <p>As a Security Analyst, their job to analyse the real-time and ongoing alerts and data from their security products such as Intrusion protection and prevention systems, security solutions, web proxies, network security devices, vulnerability scanning and management systems. As with ongoing and data that comes in with being an analyst, they also are involved in incident responses, alongside checking vulnerabilities of any system, taking security operation tasks on a needed basis. This job is really appealing as I can just analyse the problems that systems may be experience and figure out a solution. And with every problem, situation that I may face as a security analyst or just in general, it is always something you can learn from the next time I face something similar in the future.</p>
      <p>In addition, the added benefit being part of either being flexible or a part of a rotation schedule to do work gives me more time to focus on both my personal life and my work life as there is more to life than just solving problems a system faces.</p>
      <h4>Skill Required</h4>
      <p>The foundation skills for being a security analysis require me to have 2+ years’ experience and knowledge in security operations or ICT. As well as an understanding of ICT technologies achieved through real world experience.  For soft skills, great problem-solving abilities is a must for analysing any problems a system may bring is being secure. Communication skills both written and verbal is a must considering that you are working alongside others solving a problem that may come up in a device’s security.  Most importantly, the passion for growing and learning new things is needed as with every situation that come at me, can be something that I can learn from.</p>
      <h4>Skills that I currently have</h4>
      <p>Aside from the knowledge of security operations or ICT that I currently don’t possess, I do possess some little knowledge in programming as I learnt Python back in High School as part of the year 10 and 11 VCE Computing, as well as some others previously mentioned such as project planning and databases. As for soft skills, I’m somewhat good with my communication skills, provided that the other team members do work on their end. And lastly, I find learning new things to be interesting, so I wouldn’t mind learning about security in IT.</p>
      <h4>Skill Learning Plan</h4>
      <p>To obtain these skills, I plan to learn them through studying at RMIT, enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology, as it can teach me knowledge of both IT and security in many technological areas. Whilst learning this knowledge and skills, I could potentially put them to use in being an intern at a company that is solely focused on improving and working with security systems of any kind. Through this, while given the opportunity to being an intern at that company, I can also take experience at it and have insight on how it feels to work at a company that’s based on security.</p>

        <h2>Personality Profile</h2>
        <h3>Myers Briggs Test (16 Personalities Test) Result: Protagonist (ENFJ-A)</h3>
        <p>The result of the protagonist would mean that I hold leadership values. I have undertaken leadership roles in the past back in high school as the school’s vice-captain for their junior and senior campus. This personality would be appropriate as working in a group will flow much easy for me, especially in the IT industry setting. This result would make me take the lead in some areas if I were in a team, also cautious and considerate with the decisions I make when working towards a certain goal and outcome as everyone’s voice matters in any major decision.</p>
        <img src="myers_briggs_1.png" alt="myersbriggs1">
        <img src="myers_briggs_2.png" alt="myersbriggs2">
        <p>When forming a team, I should consider those who are willing to listen and to work in accordance with the instructions I or some others give in reaching our goal. Especially, since protagonists tend to be empathic to others and focus on cooperation on not just them and the person, but with everyone in the team to get along and work together as it is better to unite and face problems and challenges together as a team rather than alone, leading them to a goal that we all share.</p>

        <h3>Big Five Personality Test Results:</h3>
        <img src="online_learning_style_result.png" alt="onlinelearningstleresult">
        <p>The results show that my learning Style is well rounded, with the Reflector style and Activist style being the styles that mostly match me, with the theorist style being the lowest percentage the matches me. Being an activist means to immerse themselves in new experiences which I do enjoy, especially with facing problems that I can learn from and understand the next time I may face. However, as they tend to act first, they only think of the consequences of their actions later, which can really be a weakness, especially within a group setting when doing something that the group did not agree upon, nor were made aware of the action that I committed.</p>
        <p>The reflector style on the other hand is those that stand back and observe what is happening around them, being cautious and process things first before committing to the act next. This style describes me more as I tend to gather data first and process each part of it before coming to a conclusion. Especially within a group discussion, where every member has their say and give their thoughts to whatever topic that we discuss.</p>
        <p>This way, I can think and consider every member’s circumstance and come to an agreement based on the topic and the opinion of others. With both styles in mind, I would hope that the members are willing and able to hear each other out and have their say in discussions as it is better to plan with everyone and just do decisions out of a rush for time. </p>

        <h3>Leadership Style Test Result: Contarian Leader</h3>
        <img src="leadership_style_test_result.png" alt="leadershipstyletestresult">
        <p>A contrarian leader correlates to how some of the other tests relate to me, with the added description of holding conflicting ideas and perspectives for long periods of time and delegating decisions to other team members. Based on my experiences, I can confirm that this is the case. Not just with group discussions, but anything conflicting in my personal life that comes up, it can make me overthink about things for a long time. While consideration of conflicting ideas is good in a group work setting, it can be a bad thing, especially with my behaviour towards others since it would be hard to come to an agreement with other members despite different perspectives from different kinds of people in a team. I can take account to this by having team members that are willing to listen to reasons from others and those who will stay on task should come the time I ever do give someone a task and a responsibility to uphold.</p>

      <section id=ProjectIdea>
        <article>
        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <h3>Idea Name: Vocal Reviewer</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This project is pretty much a software or a service that will allow users to review their vocals thoroughly and be given feedback and advice on how to improve as a normal vocal teacher or coach would. Through this, this will allow anyone of any skill level of singing to practice and improve upon their voice anytime and anywhere they wish, provided they can access this of course. Additionally, aside from giving advice on vocals, how it does give advice will be based on the software’s features that will allow it too accurately tell what pitch, key, and tone the vocalist is giving upon singing.</p>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>As the project’s purpose is to help improve people’s vocals of anyone in any skill level, this can prove to be useful for aspiring performers or to those who just want to improve their voice for whatever reason that they see fit. Most importantly, this is accessible to anyone, and pretty much follows the same structure as a normal person would take lessons from a music teacher, warmups, advice, and music theory, it happens in this service as it would normally with a teacher in real life. And while somewhat similar products are out there in the market (i.e., Masterclass), this one is different in the sense that the user is guided by the software itself. </p>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>For the user to use the software, they require a device, preferably an PC with Windows or MacOS or an Apple or Android device with the software installed. Either way, both must have an Microphone input for the software to register and process the user’s voice for feedback. </p>
        <p>Aside from the products main purpose, there is a multitude of features that aid in reaching its purpose, all the while helping users in improving and understanding more about vocals and music theory as well. </p>
        <h5>Vocal Warmup and Exercise Sim</h5>
        <p>Before performing or going any further using the other software’s features, one of the most important things that a vocalist needs to do is to warm up their voice. This is performed through various methods, whilst taking account into the user’s vocal skill and preferences in warming up. Warmups performed can range from lip trills to performing vocal scales and warmups, strengthening, and warming up the user’s voice, as it would when an athlete warms up through stretching their limbs as an athlete’s physique and vocalist’s voice involves muscles that allow them to perform their activities respectively related to them.</p>
        <h5>Vocal Performance and Review</h5>
        <p>After finishing the warmup sim, the user may proceed with performing songs of any kind as they wish. Upon choosing the song, the user will be greeted with a screen of the lyrics of the song they are going to perform, along with the duration of the song, the scale and timing of which they are performing during the song and the scale, as if they were doing karaoke, but with a twist that the user’s performance is taken note of and registered such as an actual vocal teacher would hearing their student perform. And as with a vocal teacher, its their job to give feedback and advice on improvement. After finishing the performance of the song of their choosing, the software then displays user’s results, allowing the user to replay their performance, as well the tone, volume, pitch and key the song is originally performed in against how the user performed in their cover of the song.</p>
        <p>Aside from this, in any area that the software notices that the user is weak in during their performance, they will provide the user some advice and feedback in either for the whole song or in a particular verse, bridge or chorus of the song. In addition to this, the software will take note of it in their next session with the user, choosing warmups of a different kind or in a different key that is appropriate for the user for their voice and appropriate in their vocals that they need to improve upon.</p>
        <h5>Pitch, Tone and Key detection and correction</h5>
        <p>These appear through the user warming up, performing a song, or doing vocal exercises.	 How it detects and registers the user’s voice is very precise, indicating the pitch, tone, and key they are giving off in their voice. As for correction, that appears at an end of a exercise or performance, showing a graph of the song’s original key, pitch and tone against how the user performed in their cover of the song. </p>
        <h5>Session Duration</h5>
        <p>Everyone in any field has their limits, and as so with singing, the software reminds the user the ideal duration they should sing and when they should stop, as further singing and strain their voice, effectively damaging it for longer periods of singing.</p>
        <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
        <p>Any Music/Voice recording software such as Audacity, Garageband, Adobe Audition or any other open source would be required as it not only allows for recording capabilities for the user to perform, but it also have features that allow it to pitch sounds up to the appropriate key. Additionally, Python, or any other coding language would be required to build the UI and allow functions to be made for the user to give input for what features they may use in the software.</p>
        <h4>Skills Required</h4>
        <p>Coding experience is a must for this product, any experience and skill in any coding language is allowed as long as it is enough to create what is necessary to have the idea come into fruition. Next, experience with the music software used is required as it is how the software performs in receiving the users’ vocals and comparing it to the original song. Lastly, Music knowledge, preferably vocal knowledge from a professional singer is required as it would be needed to not only give feedback to the user for their vocals, but as well as performing warmups of any kind to aid in the user’s strength and knowledge with their vocals.</p>
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>Should the idea come into fruition, the project outcome would result into a service of some sort. While it was never the intent to get rid of the traditional service of real-life music and singing lessons, at least this software is accessible to those who just wish to improve their singing for whatever purpose they wish to use it for. The accessibility of this service will bring many people in to give this a try, possibly creating a generation of vocalists out of this simple service, that will create a wave of artists and songs for the foreseeable future.</p>
